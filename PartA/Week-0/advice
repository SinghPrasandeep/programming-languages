advice You Will Wish You Followed!

In each REPL session, follow this pattern:

    First type use "foo.sml"; for any SML files you want to use.
    Then use the REPL manually as long as you wish.
    After using the REPL to test something, do not use use to load (or reload) any more files.
    When tempted to violate the previous point, end and restart your REPL session before continuing.
